Minigeo is a lightweight Java library that allows one to plot geographical data (namely lines between points determined by a latitude-longitude pair), using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projections.

<p>
The display is done using a swing JFrame. The user may pan and zoom as in e.g. Google Maps (i.e. drag to pan, scroll to zoom).

It is especially useful for educators, as students can very easily use this library during practical sessions.
